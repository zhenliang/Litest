Litest, a super lite C++ testing framework implemention inspired by CppUnitLite.

Usage:
    - Just include litest.h and all is settled.
    - See demo.cpp for details.

Short Sample:

    // file: main.cpp

    #include "litest.h"

    TEST(SimpleDemo)
    {
        CHECK(1 > 2); 
    }

    int main()
    {
        return 0;
    }
